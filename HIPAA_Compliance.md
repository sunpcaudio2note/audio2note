# HIPAA Compliance and Security

At Audio2Note, we are deeply committed to protecting the privacy and security of patient health information (PHI). Our platform is designed with HIPAA compliance as a core principle.

## Key Security Measures

### 1. Data Encryption
All data, including audio files and transcribed text, is encrypted both **in transit** between your system and our service, and **at rest** on our secure servers. We use industry-standard encryption protocols to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of your data.

### 2. Minimal Data Exposure
Our system is designed to minimize the exposure of PHI. We only process the audio recording itself and do not require any other personally identifiable information (e.g., patient name, DOB, MRN).

### 3. Data Retention and Deletion
Audio files and the generated text are **permanently deleted** from our service as soon as a processing job is successfully completed. We do not retain any PHI longer than is strictly necessary to provide the service.

### 4. Business Associate Agreement (BAA)
We provide a formal Business Associate Agreement (BAA) to all our clients. This agreement contractually obligates Audio2Note to protect PHI in accordance with HIPAA regulations.

## Caregiver Responsibility

While we provide a secure and compliant platform, the end-user (the "Caregiver") is solely and exclusively responsible for the clinical accuracy and appropriateness of all patient records. The output of the Audio2Note service is a draft and must be thoroughly reviewed, edited, and verified by a licensed professional before being entered into a patient's permanent medical record.
