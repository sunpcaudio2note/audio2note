# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## Using the Service

### Q: How long does it take for an audio file to be processed?

## Accuracy & Responsibility

### Q: How accurate is the transcription and the generated note?
A: Our service uses advanced Artificial Intelligence to transcribe audio and generate clinical notes. While it is a powerful tool, it is not perfect and may produce errors or omissions.

### Q: Who is responsible for the final clinical note?
A: **The licensed caregiver is solely and exclusively responsible for the clinical accuracy and appropriateness of all patient records.** You must thoroughly review, edit, and verify all output generated by the service before it becomes part of a patient's permanent medical record.

## Privacy & Security

### Q: Is the service HIPAA compliant?
A: Yes. We are committed to protecting patient data. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest, we have a formal Business Associate Agreement (BAA) in place, and we minimize data exposure by design. For more details, please see our [HIPAA Compliance](HIPAA_Compliance.md) documentation.

### Q: What patient information is sent to the service?
A: To protect patient privacy, only the audio recording itself is sent to our service. No other personally identifiable information (such as name, date of birth, or medical record number) is required.

### Q: Is the audio recording stored permanently?
A: No. The audio file and the generated transcription text are **permanently deleted** from our service as soon as the processing job is successfully completed.
