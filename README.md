## Overview

Clinical documentation is a critical but time-consuming task for healthcare professionals. The burden of manual data entry leads to burnout, reduces patient face-time, and increases the risk of errors. **Audio2Note** is a secure, HIPAA-compliant service designed to solve this problem. It provides a seamless workflow to transform audio from patient encounters into structured clinical notes, complete with AI-generated billing codes, which can be integrated into any Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system via a modern REST API.

## Key Features

-   üéôÔ∏è **Audio Transcription:** Upload audio files (`.wav`, `.mp3`, `.m4a`, `.flac`, `.ogg`) for fast and accurate transcription.
-   ‚úçÔ∏è **Structured Note Generation:** Automatically generate structured clinical notes (SOAP, H&P) from transcribed text.
-   **AI-Powered Coding:** Leverage advanced AI with Chain-of-Thought and Few-Shot prompting for highly accurate ICD-10, HCPCS, and E/M code suggestions.
-   üîí **HIPAA-Compliant Security:** End-to-end encryption, secure data handling, and a commitment to patient privacy.
-   ‚öôÔ∏è **REST API for EMR Integration:** A flexible and well-documented REST API allows for seamless integration with any EMR or clinical software.
-   **Tiered Priority Processing:** A waitlist system prioritizes jobs based on subscription tiers, ensuring faster turnaround for premium users.

## Technology Stack

| Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Python** | Core backend logic and API development. |
| **FastAPI** | High-performance web framework for the REST API. |
| **Docker** | Containerization for consistent development and deployment. |
